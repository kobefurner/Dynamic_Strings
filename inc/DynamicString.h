/**
 * DynamicString class which stores strings
 * using dynamically sized char arrays.
 *
 * The char array should be null-terminated so
 * as to be compatible with c_string functions.
 * This means that the last character in the string
 * should always be the null character '\0'.  When
 * counting the length of the string the null character
 * does not count.  However, when allocating the array
 * you need to make sure to always include an extra position
 * for storing the null character.
 *
 * Certain methods assume an 8-bit ascii char representation.
 *
 * You are not allowed to remove or rename any of the
 * data memebers of methods from this class.  However
 * you can add additional data members and methods as
 * you see fit.  You can also change the method
 * implementations as needed.
